c.	Print out product ID’s, unit prices, quantities sold, and the sales of each product. Also print out the total units sold and the total sales. 

d.	Turn in source programs, and output that should include but not
limited to: original data (array of structures), sorted array, and the total sales and total units sold.


e.	The following should apply to all assignments during the semester.
Turn in with hard copy and the program and the output must be professional and the turn in should include the source Program, and the displayed outputs as described above. Proper messages in the output are required to indicate the execution and different outputs. Turn in all assignments in class.
